excerpt: "How I'm building a simple app to track and categorize my daily business tasks, so I can finally delegate operations and focus on growing the company instead of drowning in endless operational work."

This is a question I've asked myself many times already. Not because I want to stop working altogether like the Instagram gurus preach, but because I want to spend more time working on the company instead of in it—buried under endless operational tasks.

Now, don't get me wrong. Operations have their beauty. You execute, most tasks don't require the biggest brainpower anymore, because you've done them countless times and at the end of the day you get that little "hit of accomplishment". This hit can be really fulfilling, but I personally am not a fan of repetition unless we're talking health routines. 
My **entrepreneurial brain** gets restless. I need to create, try things and experiment to get inspiration.

## Asking for Help with Business Delegation

One evening I decided to tackle this issue again and asked one of my trusted coaches Claude the following:

> "I'm trying to get myself out of many operating tasks in the business, so I can focus on developing the business further.
> Can you help frame a plan that I can execute to get there?"

Claude gave me a neat **4–6 month business transformation plan**. The first step was the Assessment Phase (Week 1–2):
    •    Audit your current involvement by documenting everything you do for 1–2 weeks.
    •    Categorize tasks into:
    •    Strategic work (vision, partnerships, major decisions)
    •    Management oversight (team guidance, quality control)
    •    Operational tasks (routine processes, admin work)
    •    "Only you can do this" items (external relationships, specialized knowledge)
    •    Identify your highest-value activities—the ones that truly require your skills, experience, or authority and directly impact business growth.

I liked the approach. But I also knew I'd struggle sticking to it, because I'm basically the king of multitasking.

## My Solution: Build a Task Tracking Tool

So I asked myself: How can I make it efficient to log all these things I'm doing?

And then it clicked. This could be a new **vibecoding side project**. A simple **productivity app** that helps me with the assessment phase.

Here's how it works:

**Step 1: Quick Decision Popup (Small & Fast)**
    •    Text: "I noticed you switched windows. Do you want to:"
    •    Button 1: Log a task → Opens Step 2
    •    Button 2: Pause → Pauses monitoring for selected duration
    •    Dropdown: 15 mins, 30 mins, 60 mins (pause duration)

**Step 2: Task Details Popup (only if "Log a task" is clicked)**
    •    Describe your task: [Text input field]
    •    Task type: [Dropdown ▼]
    •    Delegatable: [Yes/No ▼]
    •    [Cancel] [Save Task]

## The Output

This gives me a **comprehensive database** of everything I'm doing—classified by task type and marked as delegateable or not.

And of course I had to get a domain and code a landing page for the application. Because what's a side project without proper branding, right? Check out more details and try it yourself at **[switchlogger.com](https://switchlogger.com)**. 

P.S.: The whole thing turned out pretty neat, and I'm already getting insights into where my time actually goes (spoiler alert: way too much admin work). If you're dealing with similar delegation struggles or just curious about the app, head over there and see if it might help you too.

Update 12. September 2025:
I'm still using the tool every day (and sometimes it really annoys me). BUT it always reminds me to think of what I'm doing right now, and this helps me be present while working and structure my day.
I did add a couple of new features that I thought would add to better usability, but didn't have the chance to publish them yet.
