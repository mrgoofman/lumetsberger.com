When a company grows and you're suddenly responsible for *everything*, at some point you'll hit a wall. That's exactly what just happened to me.

I couldn't keep track of all past client conversations and new opportunities anymore. My Gmail inbox had become the messy center of client communication. I was using "Tasks" in Gmail to remind me of follow-ups, and I had a self-built Notion "CRM" which no one except me ever used.

In short: I constantly had the feeling there was *so much potential* if only I had a proper system - a real CRM.

## Where Do You Even Start With a CRM?

The problem is, I had no idea what I was even looking for.

So I did the classic thing: I asked my newest best buddy ChatGPT. I literally typed:

> "We're a small 3D studio and want to introduce a CRM. I have no idea what kind of CRM we need or what's best for our needs. Can you ask me a set of questions to help figure that out?"

And honestly? That approach was *incredible*.

It didn't require me to know *anything* about CRMs upfront. ChatGPT basically became a personal CRM consultant. Asking me smart, tailored questions that helped understand what *we* as company actually need in a system.

## Shortlist: Streak, Close, and Zoho

Once I had clarity, I narrowed it down to three CRM options:

- [Streak](https://www.streak.com)
- [Close](https://www.close.com)
- [Zoho CRM](https://www.zoho.com/crm)

Why those? Because we needed a system that:

- Connects natively to Gmail
- Automatically recognizes and logs leads based on email history
- Keeps all past client communication in one place

Context is everything. Having a CRM without that email history would be basically useless for us.

## Why We Chose Close.com

Once all three tools were connected to Gmail, it became obvious: [Close.com](https://www.close.com) was the most intuitive and aligned with what we needed.

### What I Liked Instantly

- **Onboarding was smooth and smart.**  
  It suggested leads and contacts based on existing conversations. I could pick and choose who to import into the CRM.
  
- **Granular filter options.**  
  Way more flexibility than the others. You can build custom views for whatever: new leads, past clients, job applicants, filter by number of written emails last contact, and and and.

- **Intuitive and simple.**  
  No need to fight the system or dig through complicated menus.

## What I Wanted as a Founder and currently One-Person Sales Team

Here's what I personally needed from a CRM:

- A single overview showing:
  - Who I need to follow up with on current projects
  - Which past clients haven't heard from me in 3+ months
  - Who responded recently and still needs a reply from *me*

- A click into a lead shows:
  - All past conversations
  - My notes
  - An AI-generated summary of the client  
    (super useful if I ever bring someone else into sales)

- The ability to do personalized *and* mass outreach:
  - Christmas mails
  - Updates to past customers
  - Launches of new projects

- Clear deal stages:
  - Where each lead is in the pipeline
  - What action is needed next
  - Automated reminders if a lead has gone cold

- A system that scales:
  - Easy to understand for new keyaccount and sales peoples
  - All information i none place - best for future ai features
  - Loads of integrations with other SaaS products.


## Where We Are Now

Things just work. Follow-Ups don't fall through anymore. We got an amazing overview of our past and current clients, of our partners and suppliers and evene applicants. Honestly without it, we'd have a really hard time.

## My Takeaway: Don't Start With CRMs. Start With Questions.

There are sooo many CRM tools out there. And it's *so easy* to pick the wrong one.

Before trying any CRM, ask yourself:

- Why do I open the CRM?
- What do I want to *see* the moment it opens?
- What's my next action?
- And then?
- And then?
- What happens after that?
- Does this CRM (need to) scale?
- [Seriously—follow your mental process all the way through.]

And of course, **ask ChatGPT like you would a CRM consultant.**  
The advice you'll get is basically free, and *very* tailored—if you feed it the right info.

Try to start with open-ended prompts and let ChatGPT show you how big this topic really is. The better you understand your current situation *and* where you're heading, the more useful the answers will be.

That's it. Those are my honest thoughts on choosing and setting up a CRM as a founder.

If you're in the same boat—overwhelmed by client convos, feeling like there's opportunity slipping through the cracks—this might help you get on track too.
