Welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm an entrepreneur who loves starting things and exploring bold ideas.

I co-founded [**rendersnek**](https://rendersnek.com), a 3D animation studio creating FOOH and DOOH content for global brands, and launched [**FOOH.com**](https://FOOH.com), the largest curated archive of commercial Fake Out Of Home & CGI campaigns.

When I'm not building, I'm experimentingâ€”vibecoding with AI tools, automating creative workflows, or sharing what I've learned through my blog and talks.
