# I'm Moritz – Entrepreneur, Builder, Vibecoder

![Moritz Lumetsberger](/images/profiles/moritz-lumetsberger-2.jpg)

I'm an entrepreneur who loves starting things and exploring bold ideas. Co-founder of [rendersnek](https://rendersnek.com) (3D animation studio) and [FOOH.com](https://FOOH.com) (largest FOOH & CGI archive).

When I'm not building, I'm experimenting—vibecoding with AI tools, automating creative workflows, or sharing what I've learned.
