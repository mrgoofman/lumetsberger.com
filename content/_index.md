Welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm Moritz Lumetsberger, an entrepreneur who loves starting things and exploring bold ideas.

I co-founded **[rendersnek](https://rendersnek.com)**, a 3D animation studio creating FOOH and DOOH content for global brands, and launched **[FOOH.com](https://FOOH.com)**, the largest curated archive of commercial Fake Out Of Home & CGI campaigns.

When I'm not building, I'm experimentingâ€”vibecoding with AI tools, automating creative workflows, or sharing what I've learned through my blog and talks.

Curiosity, creativity, and connection drive everything I do.
