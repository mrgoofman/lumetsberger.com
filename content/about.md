# 👋 About Me

I'm an entrepreneur who loves starting things and exploring bold ideas. I co-founded **[rendersnek](https://rendersnek.com)**, a 3D animation studio creating FOOH and DOOH content for global brands, and launched **[FOOH.com](https://FOOH.com)**, the largest curated archive of commercial Fake Out Of Home & CGI campaigns.

When I'm not building, I'm experimenting—vibecoding with AI tools, automating creative workflows, or sharing what I've learned in workshops and talks. Curiosity, creativity, and connection drive everything I do.
